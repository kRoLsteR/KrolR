```{r setup, include=FALSE}

```

1. Do simple math with numbers, addition, subtraction, multiplication, division
```{r}
2+7

47*5
```

2. Put numbers into variables, do simple math on the variables
```{r}
ab<-47*5
```

3. Write code that will place the numbers 1 to 100 separately into a variable using for loop. Then, again using the seq function.
```{r}

```

4. Find the sum of all the integer numbers from 1 to 100.
you can use the sum() function on a vector of numbers
```{r}

```

5. How would you do this without using the sum function? For example, how could you use a for loop to accomplish this task?
```{r}

```

6. Write a function to find the sum of all integers between any two values.
```{r}

```
